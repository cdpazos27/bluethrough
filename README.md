# bluethrough
An android applicattion designed to extend the range of bluetooth device by using a switched network of smartphones.

				                            WIP
This repository contains two projects: Bluethrough and BluethroughV2. Bluethrough was our first attempt to make a switched network for message
relay between android devices using Bluetooth. We dipped our toes into app development for the first time and succesfully failed in doing so.
You'll find broken code, some snippets of Bluetooth mesh and some basic code for Bluetooth operations.

BluethroughV2 is our working implementation of this idea, using Google's Nearby Connections API.
